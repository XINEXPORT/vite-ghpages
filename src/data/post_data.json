      "title": "Learning ES|QL",
      "content": "I decided to attend the ES|QL meetup at Improving Dallas hosted by Elasticsearch. I’ve always been curious about Elasticsearch and wanted to know more about them. Afterall, the Dallas AI group spoke highly of the company and I recently met a DevMountain alumni that now works as the Principal Tech lead for them. From the meetup, I learned that ES|QL is a brand-new query language made by Elasticsearch. Then I started thinking, what is Elasticsearch, really? And it seems like they provide Back-end as a Service, much like AWS, Azure, and Google. It’s like another cloud tool that enables scalable web architecture, but with a focus on their search queries and data management tools. According to the presenter Sajit, ES|QL is a piped query language. This wrung a bell for as I am currently studying R and it also uses piping in its search query syntax. It uses some very familiar search statements, such as FROM, WHERE, and SORT along with some new terminology like KEEP, STATS BY, and EVAL. Overall, the UI and the syntax seems simple enough to understand looking if a user is doing a basic search query. However, they’re might be a learning curve when someone wants to use the ENRICH statement, which is like a JOIN statement in SQL. Basically, ENRICH can add data from a specific search index to an output query, which sounds a lot like a join. The thing is that you won’t be able to use ENRICH unless policies are established before running the query. That can be kinda time consuming and maybe a little disorganized, especially if someone is adding data from multiple data sources. That means I would need to make multiple policies and declare which policy to use for the enrichment. I dunno, maybe it’s not hard at all and it’s just a new thing that I’m not familiar with. We shall see! -Christine Hoang, 2/21/2024"

      "title": "Video Editing is Underated",
      "content": "A hidden skill I feel like most Millennials and Gen Z’rs are familiar yet no one talks about is video editing. Back in the early 2000s video editing was a rare commodity. You needed fast computing power, proprietary video editing tools, and expensive cameras to shoot the highest resolution. Fast forward 20 years into the future, there are now apps and phones that can do the same amount of work with less money and time. I spent all day working on my art and music. Sometimes, my version of a break isn’t really a break at all, but being creative. Like mashing up various sources of artful medias I’ve made and sharing it to the world is fun to me. I rarely get to do it! I also needed to stop my Soundcloud subscription and Youtube is a free app. I did the Math and decided to transfer all my songs to the tube. That meant that all my songs needed a photo, or a video tied to them. The only thing I could think of was screenshotting my coded art and adding it to my audio in Adobe Premier. Some of the photos and videos are low res. It’ll do for now. We’re not aiming for perfect here, we’re striving for the minimum! One day ill look into high res video recording to replace these videos. For now, my songs are up and that’s all that matters. – Christine Hoang, March 4, 2024"

      "title": "HackerRank, the Standard",
      "content": "I've been building my HackRank profile account in preparation for a potential interview I might have with JPMC. I applied to be a Quality Engineer, which I am qualified for the job...I just haven't QA in over a year. And I mean formally QA'd. Generally, I feel like everyone is a QA not matter what job they perform in the tech sphere. The QAs though have a different set of tools and processes that most don't follow. I remember over a year ago, I learned all the QA tools, but since I haven’t used them in over a year, I forgot. It's so impossible to remember all these languages and tools, but it doesn't mean I dont know about them and how they work. Anyway, I am getting off topic. So far, I have attained profile badges on my Hackrank, such as SQL and Problem Solving. I am working on getting my algos and data structures badge, but these challenges are very difficult. I’ve been trying to target the easy ones first. I’m pretty sure im going to have to solve them multiple times to get them engrained in my brain. Maybe I can hit up some of my friends to get an idea of what coding challenges they will ask. -Christine Hoang, March 3, 2024"

      "title": "International Women’s Day",
      "content": "I celebrated International Women’s Day by volunteering for the Women Who Code Event that invited the CEO, Julie Elberfeld to the CBRE headquarters. It was a fun event sponsored by CBRE and Paladin consulting, which were courteous to provide the most robust food spread i’ve seen this year.",
      "content1": "I learned a lot about Julie. She studied advanced theoretical Mathematics. Eventually she switched to programming when she joined a team of coders in where they all taught her how to write code. She became the division Chief information Officer in the banking industry. She landed a job at Capital One working as an Account Executive for their DEI initiatives which is cool because that mean she was one of the contributors of Capital One’s Internship and Outreach programs. I mean, out all the banks, Capital One and JPM strongly support DEI.",
      "content2": "She shared a fact about how 25% of women can be found working in IT; whereas 40% of women between the 70s-80s comprised of the entire industry. Why the shift? Maybe IT work has been redefined since that time.",
      "content3": "We all came to a consensus at the end of the chat where women have a hard time climbing up to executive leadership. Possibly it’s because advocates within the industry are hard to come by. A woman in the group even mentioned that other women who have climbed to the top don’t advocate for others. I have personally encountered this as well.",
      "content4": "Overall, I am grateful Women Who Code hosted this event. It’s consoling that other women have experienced barriers navigating through their careers and that we are not isolated in this journey."
